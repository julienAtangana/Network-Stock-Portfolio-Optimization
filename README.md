# Network-Stock-Portfolio-Optimization
From correlations to networks: mapping the market to beat the S&P 500.

This project explores the stock market through the lens of network analysis.
Instead of looking at stocks in isolation, we build a graph-based representation where nodes are stocks and edges represent their correlations.

What you’ll find in this repo:

Year-by-year stock return analysis

Correlation networks to visualize how stocks move together

Filtering techniques to keep only the most relevant connections

Network centrality measures (degree, closeness, betweenness, eigenvector) to identify key stocks in the market

Comparison against the S&P 500 index to evaluate our strategy

Key idea: by simplifying the market into a network, we can spot influential stocks, hidden structures, and potential opportunities that traditional analysis might miss.
